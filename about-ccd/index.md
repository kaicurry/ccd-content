# About CCD

The **Center for Collaborative Democracy** is a non-profit, nonpartisan, tax exempt 501 (c) 3 organization. Our mission is to develop innovative methods that will encourage Americans to participate constructively in civic life and will enable communities to reach optimal decisions on critical issues.

CCD grew out of the MIT-Harvard Public Disputes Program, which for two decades has refereed political conflicts from local housing battles to worldwide environmental clashes.

CCD has done extensive research on political adversaries _outside_ of government who have negotiated constructive agreements on highly contentious issues. As a result, we have found practical ways to motivate political adversaries _inside_ government to develop equally constructive solutions.  A full description of our research and conclusions can be found in the recently published book,  The Cure for Our Broken Political Process. For more information about the book, [click here][1].

Our current efforts are focused on providing communities with the tools that will enable them to develop creative solutions to long-standing conflicts.
