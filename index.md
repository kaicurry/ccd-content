## Overcoming Gridlock to Build Nationwide Prosperity

-   We Help Communities Solve Chronic Problems
    
    If your city or town is struggling with a long-standing controversy, CCD can help organize a group of community residents who will be in the best position to negotiate a constructive solution.

    If your town council or school board has been struggling with chronic problems, we can help your community reorganize the council or board so that it will be better equipped to develop fair, intelligent solutions.

    If you are a member of a city or state legislature deadlocked over a crucial issue, we can help your legislature form a task force that will be in the best position to craft an optimal solution.

    We have found that virtually any group of people can resolve a controversial issue by assembling the “appropriate” group of representatives. By “appropriate,” we mean that everyone involved can point to at least one representative as someone they trust to speak for them on the issues at hand.

-   Economists left, right and center largely agree that Americans in every socio-economic group could prosper _if_ we upgrade our public schools to match the best in the world, simplify the tax code by closing loopholes and lowering marginal tax rates,  curb the growth in entitlement spending, and invest judiciously in infrastructure.

    But nearly every member of Congress clearly prefers to attack the other party's agenda rather than negotiate an economic plan that could benefit Americans of all kinds.

    Why do we, the American people, accept this? We don’t have to.

    There are prominent Americans from the left, right and center who would gladly sit down together to negotiate a plan that leads to wide prosperity while reining in our nation's debts.

    So, we at CCD intend to make this happen. We're building a coalition of nonprofit organizations and civic-minded individuals to jointly sponsor a Forum for Long-Term Prosperity.

    The Forum will bring together in one place the men and whom the American people would most trust to solve our economic problems. We will ask these men and women to work out a fiscal/economic plan that voters of all kinds could support. Once they agree on that plan, they will present it to the American people.

    And if enough voters support that plan, lawmakers hungry to keep their jobs will have to listen.
